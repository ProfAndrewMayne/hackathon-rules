# Cheating Response Procedure

The following is a guide of actions to be taken in the case of an accusation that a team cheated or otherwise violated the rules of competition. 

Accusations of cheating may include but are not limited to:

- A team using somebody elseâ€™s code
- A team misrepresenting the work they did
- A team having too many team members
- A team using code that was written outside the event

To determine the validity of cheating instances [Hackathon Rules](https://github.com/ProfAndrewMayne/hackathon-rules/blob/master/Rules.md) will be used.

## Accusation

If you suspect cheating, or you are an organizer who has been made aware of an accusation of cheating, please get in touch with the event staff. If you are still at the event, go and find the onsite representative. If it is after the event, please email  SEITHackathon@durhamcollege.ca. The following steps are to be followed by staff.

## Document the Report

Try to get as much of the allegation in written form by the reporter. If you cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you. The important information to gather include the following:

- Identifying information (name, email, phone, etc.) of the reporter
- Identifying information (name, email, phone, etc.) of the participant/team accused of cheating
- Reason the reporter suspects cheating
- Other people suspected to be involved in the cheating
- Other witnesses / people who suspect the cheating
- Any relevant URLs (e.g. for GitHub repos or Devpost pages)

There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:

- Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff responsibility
- Do not offer them input into penalties. This is the staff's responsibility

Once something is reported to a staff member, immediately contact the Hacakthon Team at SEITHackathon@durhamcollege.ca with the details you have documented.

Once the Hackathon Team has been contacted they will work with the staff member to loop in the event organizer if they are not already involved.
The Hackathon Team will then investigate the allegation by reviewing public materials about the hack, including project repos, project submissions, and anything else available to them. 

## Response

### Cheating Did Not Occur

If it is determined that cheating did not occur, they will compile a report and inform the organizer and the reporter.

### Other Outcomes

If we are unable to determine that cheating did not occur based on publicly available resources, the organizer will then communicate with the alleged cheater. Informing them of what has been reported about them.
Allow the alleged cheater to give their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report stands, let the alleged cheater know what actions will be taken against them.

Some actions for the staff to consider when dealing with alleged cheating offenders:

- Warning the cheater to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions
- Not allowing the participants to demo
- Not allowing the participants to win prizes
- Revocation of prizes & recognitions
- Banning the participants from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
- Publishing an account of the cheating
